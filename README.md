The Grade Analysis Program is a Java application that allows users to enter test scores, stores them in a dynamic list, and calculates key statistical measures:

- Average Score – Computes the running average of all entered test scores.
- Minimum Score – Identifies the lowest score using Collections.min().
- Maximum Score – Finds the highest score using Collections.max().
- The program continuously prompts the user for input, allowing them to enter multiple test scores. It employs a loop-based system where users can enter grades between 0 and 100. If an invalid value is entered (less than -1), an error message is displayed. The program terminates when the user inputs -1, at which point it displays all grades, the average score, the minimum score, and the maximum score.

This project demonstrates user input handling, list manipulation, and data processing using Java, providing a structured approach to real-time grade analysis.
